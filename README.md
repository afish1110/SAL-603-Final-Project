# SAL 603 Final Project
 This contains all of the code and data for the final project. This project was completed with Benett Dervishaj, Xander Cho, and Derek Cunius.

## Project Details
The goal of this project is to determine what makes a dominant pitcher. This was accomplished by looking at the Cy Young Award Winners from 2010 to 2019. The data in the folder for Xander's and Bennet's code is the concatenated csv so if going to run it will have to put in a read statment for that file.
